# Inconsistent-mouse-and-desync-fix

   - make sure Enhance Pointer Precision is turned off
   - delete everything in HKCU\Control Panel\Mouse
   - add my settings from here: https://github.com/Hyyote/files-/blob/main/mouse.reg
   - shut down the computer and unplug the keyboard and mouse
   - with both peripherals unplugged, start up the PC and wait until it boots into Windows
   - now plug in the keyboard and mouse and there, you can enjoy being in charge of your inputs again
<br>
   - This process has to be repeated every time.
