# Inconsistent-mouse-and-desync-fix

   - shut down the computer and unplug the keyboard and mouse
   - with both peripherals unplugged, start up the PC and wait until it boots into Windows
   - now plug in the keyboard and mouse and that's it, you can enjoy being in charge of your inputs again

This process has to be repeated every time.
